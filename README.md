# TIPE
My TIPE project in preparation school.  
__Suject__ : Crowd movement simulation  

## How to use
Compilation is done with the ̀compile` file, written in bash  
```
$ bash compile
```
## Map creation 
The directory `map_maker/` contains a map maker tool.

## Changing the simulated agents
All the agents are following checkpoints, to then go to the finish line.  
You can change their checkpoints, change de finish line, and add more agents in the `main.c` file.
